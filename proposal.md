# Visual Improvement Implementation Task: Section and Page Templates

## Context
You are working on a Zola static site blog with a Base16 One Dark theme. The blog uses Tailwind CSS v3 and has both section pages (article listings) and individual page templates (article content). The goal is to improve the visual design while maintaining the existing Base16 color scheme and technical foundation.

## Current File Structure
- `templates/section.html` - Article listing pages (blog index, tech index)
- `templates/page.html` - Individual article pages
- `static/input.css` - Main stylesheet with Base16 colors and prose styling
- Base16 color variables are defined as CSS custom properties (--c00 through --c0f)

## Reference Style Inspiration
The visual improvements should draw inspiration from these clean, minimal blog designs:
- **Zhuia**: Minimalist card layouts with subtle hover effects. (https://zhuia.netlify.app/)
- **Tchartron**: Professional spacing and typography hierarchy. (https://tchartron.com/)
- **TartanLlama**: Elegant article layouts with excellent readability. (https://tartanllama.xyz/posts/wasm-plugins/)

## Specific Improvements Required

### 1. Section Page (Article Listings) Improvements

**Current Issues:**
- Cards have heavy 4px borders that feel too prominent
- Hover scale effect (scale-[1.05]) is too aggressive
- Grid spacing could be more refined
- Date formatting looks technical rather than elegant
- Metadata (word count, reading time) could be better organized

**Required Changes:**
- Replace thick borders with subtle shadows and lighter borders (1-2px max)
- Change hover effect from scaling to a gentle lift (translate-y and shadow change)
- Improve grid spacing and card proportions
- Enhance date formatting to be more readable
- Better organize metadata with improved spacing and hierarchy
- Add subtle hover transitions for smoother interactions

### 2. Page Template (Article Content) Improvements

**Current Issues:**
- Sidebar navigation arrows feel disconnected from content
- Content prose area lacks visual definition
- Article header spacing could be improved
- Navigation between articles could be more elegant

**Required Changes:**
- Integrate sidebar navigation better with the content flow
- Add subtle visual framing to the prose content area
- Improve article header spacing and typography hierarchy
- Enhance article navigation footer for mobile users
- Refine breadcrumb styling for better visual integration

### 3. Typography and Spacing Refinements

**Typography Improvements:**
- Increase line-height in prose from 1.7 to 1.8 for better readability
- Improve heading hierarchy with better spacing
- Enhance code block styling with subtle improvements
- Refine link styling for better consistency

**Spacing Improvements:**
- Add more generous spacing between content sections
- Improve paragraph spacing for better rhythm
- Refine margin and padding throughout templates
- Ensure consistent spacing on mobile devices

## Technical Requirements

**Must Preserve:**
- Existing Base16 color scheme (--c00 through --c0f variables)
- Tailwind CSS framework usage
- Responsive design functionality
- Current template inheritance structure
- Dark/light theme compatibility

**Implementation Guidelines:**
- Use existing color variables strategically
- Maintain or improve accessibility
- Ensure changes work across all screen sizes
- Keep hover effects subtle and professional
- Use CSS transitions for smooth interactions

## Expected Deliverables

1. **Updated section.html template** with improved card design and layout
2. **Updated page.html template** with enhanced article presentation
3. **Enhanced CSS styles** in input.css for the improvements
4. **Maintained responsive behavior** across all device sizes

## Success Criteria

- Article cards look more modern and professional
- Hover effects are subtle but noticeable
- Typography hierarchy is clear and readable
- Content feels more polished and visually appealing
- All existing functionality is preserved
- Design maintains the Base16 aesthetic while feeling more refined

Focus on making incremental improvements that collectively create a more polished, professional appearance while respecting the existing design foundation.

IMPORTANT: Continue iteratively as instructed. Propose changes and improvements, wait for user confirmation and repeat.
