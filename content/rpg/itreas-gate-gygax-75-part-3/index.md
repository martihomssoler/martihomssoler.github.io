# Week 3 - The Dungeon

Just the main floor, and in a point-crawl style. 

# Spark Tables

I made some Spark tables that I intend to use in the future to help me come up with new ideas that are grounded on my concept for Itreas. The idea is to have a pair of d6 tables per pitch/inspiration point.

For those who do not know, Spark Tables are just some random tables that usually contain a Verb and/or a Noun (I got inspired by the tables found [Mythic GME - 2ed](https://www.wordmillgames.com/page/mythic-gme.html), I can't really recommend it enough). By using them you get something like "Flawed Battle" or "Enormous Sound", which by itself are not necessarily that useful since they are generic. 

Following you can find a list of words inspired by each point in the pitch and inspiration. The process what some-what involved, but I got it pretty streamed out once I took creative liberties and copied some content in Mythic GME's tables.

#### Pitch Sparks

1.  Iron is antithetical to magic. Gold/silver/copper can absorb and store it. Iron vows are soul-binding (like Ironsworn)
	- to swear an iron vow into a jewelry piece
	- rune etched armor (iron/steel armor with copper/silver/gold runes etched to enchant it)
	- protection rings, earrings, pendants (small pieces of copper/silver/gold)
	- metal bars (the equivalent to ingots, but for the most valuable metals like gold, iron, steel)
	- metal smiths, armorers, forges
	- mines and miners
2. The world is in a constant struggle for light. (Typical light vs darkness and law vs chaos struggle, but materialized) 
	- purifying rituals
	- sacred lanterns 
	- Divine Fire
	- to enlighten a place (to clean it of Darkness)
	- dark spawns
	- hollows (when the Darkness eats you, it leaves behind a husk, those are hollows)
	- caravans transporting metal bars
	- big, vertical cities
	- 
3. Dungeons are sentient. The underworld is vast. The planet, at its core, is a literal prison for some unworldly being. 
	- Dungeon-finders (explorers specialized in finding new Dungeon entrances)
	- new entrance maps
	- cartographers
	- Dungeon-speakers (seers that can listen and communicate if the Dungeon)
	- Vast cavern (crystal, fungal, etc...)
	- Bubbles of evil (similar to WoT. Weird stuff happens and after it, a new Dungeon entrance is left behind)
	- 
4. Fallen stars contain the divine spark.
	- Starforged Iron (exactly like meteor iron, but with special properties)
	- Divine Fire (a white gem found at the core of a fallen star, which can purify against Darkness)
	- "Star-land", it is basically the land surrounding the site where a Star fell. This place has some protection against Darkness, which is not permanent and now is fading. 
	-  
5. The world is scattered and plunged into constant chaos. Government is usually tribal with warlords and city states as major players.
	- hyper-centralized city-states very far apart (usually located inside Starlands, which provides some safety), with stable and long-lasting government (like a miniature Rome)
	- Outskirts filled with small-sized tribes warring over resources and trade routes
	- 
6. A huge meteorite crashed and reshaped the continents ages ago, triggering the Divine Rush (like gold rush but looking for divine sparks) and posterior sundering.
7. Previous huge heterogeneous civilizations (no unique empire) of futuristic techno-arkanums (so like sci-fi but like 75% fantasy + 20% actual science/technology + 5% entropy?)

#### Inspiration Sparks

1. Souls-games. Aesthetics + storytelling method + moldiness. Absolute banger!
2. ICON + Dungeon Meshi (Delicious in Dungeon). Overall art style and sense of fantasy and in-world integration/cohesion.
3. Moebius + Classic/OSR Dungeons & Dragons Art. Mostly for vibes and uniqueness. Also, huge contrast from thin and intentional lines and clean colors (Moebius) to rough sketch-like b&w pieces. It really speaks to me to differentiate the "outer" world from the "inner" world. 
4. Japanese + European folklore. Just what triggers my creative processes. 
5. The Witcher + Monster Hunter + Roguelikes (in general). For the deadliness, brutality and also size differences (aka you vs a huge monster, haven't played Shadow of the Colossus but I believe it would be right my alley)
6. Warhammer-style fantasy. Like, hell yeah? I believe it embodies the entropic-mossy-desperate feeling I want to accomplish for the underworld and also has very unique takes on traditional fantasy races. 
7. Not really an inspiration, per se, but I really love "size differences" as stated before. I want to explore HUGE ruins built on top of a fossilized corpse of a titan inside a now dormant volcano.
