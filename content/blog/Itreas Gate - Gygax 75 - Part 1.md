# Intro to why Now?

- Goblin Punch -- darkness thing
- Into the Wyrd and Wyld + its city book?
- Lost Pages!!! 
- ICON
- [Gygax 75](https://plundergrounds.itch.io/gygax75)

# Week 1 - The Concept

- Pitch:
	1.  Iron is antithetical to magic. Gold/silver/copper can absorb and store it. Iron vows are soul-binding (like Ironsworn)
	2. The world is in a constant struggle for light. (Typical light vs darkness and law vs chaos struggle, but materialized) 
	3. Dungeons are sentient. The underworld is vast. The planet, at its core, is a literal prison for some unworldly being. 
	4. Fallen stars contain the divine spark.
	5. The world is scattered and plunged into constant chaos. Government is usually tribal with warlords and city states as major players.
	6. A huge meteorite crashed and reshaped the continents ages ago, triggering the Divine Rush (like gold rush but looking for divine sparks) and posterior sundering.
	7. Previous huge heterogeneous civilizations (no unique empire) of futuristic techno-arkanums (so like sci-fi but like 75% fantasy + 20% actual science/technology + 5% entropy?)
- Inspiration
	1. Souls-games. Aesthetics + storytelling method + moldiness. Absolute banger!
	2. ICON + Dungeon Meshi (Delicious in Dungeon). Overall art style and sense of fantasy and in-world integration/cohesion.
	3. Moebius + Classic/OSR Dungeons & Dragons Art. Mostly for vibes and uniqueness. Also, huge contrast from thin and intentional lines and clean colors (Moebius) to rough sketch-like b&w pieces. It really speaks to me to differentiate the "outer" world from the "inner" world. 
	4. Japanese + European folklore. Just what triggers my creative processes. 
	5. The Witcher + Monster Hunter + Roguelikes (in general). For the deadliness, brutality and also size differences (aka you vs a huge monster, haven't played Shadow of the Colossus but I believe it would be right my alley)
	6. Warhammer-style fantasy. Like, hell yeah? I believe it embodies the entropic-mossy-desperate feeling I want to accomplish for the underworld and also has very unique takes on traditional fantasy races. 
	7. Not really an inspiration, per se, but I really love "size differences" as stated before. I want to explore HUGE ruins built on top of a fossilized corpse of a titan inside a now dormant volcano. 

# Week 2 - Surrounding Area

Took the advise regarding scale. They recommended 23x14 hexes with a scale of 1 mile to 1 hex. Ofc, I changed the miles to kilometers, because 'uropean, and ended up with a 38x22km approx. 

This means the area is roughly 836 squared kilometers. As always, this means nothing to my brain so I jumped to Wikipedia to find a more familiar mental image that I could understand. My go-to for areas is to look at the Comarques of Catalonia (my homeland). [Comarques of Catalonia - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comarques_of_Catalonia)
I sorted the "List of Comarques" table by Area and looked for some area similar to 836, and low-and-behold I found [Ribera d'Ebre - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ribera_d%27Ebre). After finding a geographic map on the internet, I honestly fell in love with it, it has everything I want on my initial map (given some huge liberties that I took).

[RIBERA D'EBRE. Mapa topográfico. – Trobart Maps](https://trobart.cat/products/ribera-debre-mapa-topografic-en-color)

It has a huge river running through it. A mountain range splitting the map in two. A very mysteriously looking isolated blob of mountains to the bottom-right... I mean, I changed a lot of it, but the overall structure is there.

Not completed, tbh

# Week 3 - The Dungeon

Just the main floor, and in a point-crawl style.
