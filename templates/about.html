      I’m <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/martihomssoler/">
        Martí Homs Soler</a> — a Software Engineer,
      Co-Founder, wannabe professional Tinkerer and AI enthusiast
      currently based in Lübeck, Germany 🇩🇪.
    </p>
    <p>
      I studied Computer Science at UPC Barcelona 🏫, specializing in Computation and
      Algorithms. Over the years, I’ve worked in computer vision, industrial automation, and medical tech. I even
      co-founded <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://histolution.com/"> Histolution</a>
      🏢, a medical hardware start-up as a spin-off from Lübeck University. Right now I'm continuing my entrepenurial
      journey, but this time solo. Let's see what the future brings.
    </p>
    <p>
      I’m mainly into systems programming in Rust 🦀 (but ocasionally in C and a bit of Zig/Odin here and there). I also
      enjoy experimental tooling, and well-thought tech stacks — currently thriving on NixOS ❄️. I really like to
      try out odd programming languages like Koka and digging into theory when I need to reset my brain — like compilers
      and game engines but just for fun.
    </p>
    <p>
      This blog is my personal space, where I write mostly for myself — to explain what I’m learning, clarify ideas, or
      document rabbit holes I fall into. I use it to keep track of all the things that interest me so it may be chaotic
      at times, and unless said otherwise this is not a tutorial, but rather a personal notebook of both sucesses and
      failures.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can find interesting tech stuff under <a rel="" href="/tech"> Tech Articles </a>. It is mainly about NixOS ❄️
      (did I tell you that I use NixOS ❄️ BTW?), Ergo-Split Keyboards ⌨️ and Homelabbing, with the ocassional theory
      notes on different technologies and ideas I have.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can find some weird D&D-like OSR-adjacent 💀 stuff under <a rel="" href="/blog"> RPG Posts </a>. Here is where
      I let my creative side out regarding tabletop RPG mechanics, world-building, and random storytelling experiments.
      It helps me keep things balanced between being a Forever GM 🎲 and having the chance to play my vast collection on
      modules and systems I keep gathering.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you’re into low-level code, weird software, analog adventures or just like some OSR
      blogging/rambling/session-logs, you’ll probably find something here. I will try to keep it up to date, but only
      time will tell...
